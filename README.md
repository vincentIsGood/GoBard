# Go Bard
This is a Bard reverse engineering project, made to let me familiarize with golang 
(fyi. This is my 1st ever Golang project).

## Run it
```sh
go run main.go chat -session "<session_string>" -text "<msg_to_Bard>"
```

## Caution
It is inappropriate to use this command util extensively to interact with bard, 
since this is a reverse engineering project and a project for learning purposes.
